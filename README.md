About an hour.

I went with javascript, flexbox and momentjs. It did not seem to need a full framework.  But date management is difficult and there are a lot of edge cases so I went with moment.js to handle leap years and timezones and other edge cases..

I wanted to make the seconds flash red, maybe when minutes are down to zero.
